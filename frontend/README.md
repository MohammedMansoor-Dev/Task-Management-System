# React Frontend

This is a React-based frontend application. It serves as the user interface for the project, allowing users to interact with the backend services and view dynamic content. It is designed to be fast, responsive, and easy to extend.

## Features

- React-based UI
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Easy integration with backend services
- Component-driven architecture
- State management with [React Context / Redux] (adjust based on your app's state management solution)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn (npm comes with Node.js by default)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
```

### Environment Variables

Make sure to create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add any necessary environment variables required for your application. For example:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
REACT_APP_ENV=development
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and run the app locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will open the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build for Production

To create an optimized production build of your app, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate a `build` folder containing the optimized files that can be deployed to a web server.

```

## Testing

To run tests for your project, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn test
```

This will run your tests and output the results to the console.

## Deployment

For production deployment, you can use services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy your React app. You can also manually deploy it to any server by copying the contents of the `build` folder to your web server.

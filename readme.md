# Full Stack Application - React Frontend & Node.js/Express Backend

This project is a full-stack application consisting of a **React-based frontend** and a **Node.js/Express backend** following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture. The application provides a user interface (UI) built with React, while the backend handles the business logic and data management.

## Features

### Frontend (React)
- React-based UI
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Easy integration with backend API
- Component-driven architecture
- State management with Context/Redux (customizable)

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- RESTful API
- MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller)
- Authentication and authorization
- Database integration (MongoDB or SQL - configurable)

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **Yarn** (npm comes with Node.js by default)
- **MongoDB** (for MongoDB-based backend) or SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL) if applicable

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   If using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or, if using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables. Example:

   ```bash
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdb
   JWT_SECRET=yourjwtsecret
   ```

   Replace the values with your actual configurations (e.g., database URI, JWT secret, etc.).

4. **Run the backend server:**

   To start the backend server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or with Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   If using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or, if using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory. Example:

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

4. **Run the frontend app:**

   To start the frontend server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or with Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the Full Stack Application

- The **frontend** will send API requests to the **backend**.
- Make sure both servers are running (frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and backend at `http://localhost:5000`).
- You can now access the full-stack application by visiting the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and interact with the backend API.

## Folder Details

### Backend (`/backend`)

- **controllers/**: Contains functions that handle the logic of processing requests and returning responses.
- **models/**: Defines data models (e.g., MongoDB schemas or Sequelize models).
- **routes/**: Defines the API endpoints and routes.
- **services/**: Contains utilities like email sending, token generation, etc.
- **config/**: Configuration files (e.g., for database connection, JWT secret, etc.).
- **app.js**: Sets up the Express application and middleware.
- **server.js**: Starts the Express server.

### Frontend (`/frontend`)

- **components/**: Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, headers).
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks to handle state and side effects.
- **pages/**: Page components that represent different routes in the app.
- **services/**: Functions for interacting with the backend API (e.g., Axios calls).
- **App.js**: The root component that includes routing and global state.
- **index.js**: The entry point for the React app, where the root component is rendered.
- **App.css**: Global styles for the app.

## Testing

### Backend Testing

If you have backend tests, you can run them using the following command (if you are using a testing framework like Jest):

```bash
npm test
```

### Frontend Testing

If you have frontend tests, you can run them using:

```bash
npm test
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment

To deploy the backend, you can use platforms like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean**. Ensure your production environment variables (e.g., database URI, JWT secret) are properly set.

### Frontend Deployment

For frontend deployment, you can use platforms like **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or any static file hosting service. After building your React app, deploy the files from the `build/` folder.
